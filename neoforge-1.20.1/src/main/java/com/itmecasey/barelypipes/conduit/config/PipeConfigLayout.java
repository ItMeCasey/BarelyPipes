/**
 * Where everything sits on the pipe screen, in pixels from the top left corner of the panel.
 * The menu needs the slot positions and the screen needs the rest, and both must agree, so the
 * numbers are worked out here once from the pipe type and tier. Nothing in this class touches
 * the game, which also lets the self-test check that the panel fits on a small window.
 *
 * <p>The screen has no words on it, only glyphs, colors and numbers, laid out in rows as the
 * approved mockup ({@code assets-src/tools/ui_mockups.py}) draws them: a header with the pipe's
 * glyph, its tier gem and a small cube net that marks the face; the face modes; the distribution
 * modes, for pipes that have them; the throughput with a tier bar; the upgrade slots, for pipes
 * that take upgrades; and the player inventory.
 *
 * <p>The Filter and Priority upgrades belong to this face alone, so they get their own places at
 * the right end of the upgrade row. While one is installed, a side panel to the right of the
 * screen holds its controls: the filter's whitelist toggle and 3 by 3 ghost slots, and the
 * priority with a minus and a plus button. The menu's real slots cannot move once it is built, so
 * the side panel keeps the main panel (and the inventory) exactly where it was.
