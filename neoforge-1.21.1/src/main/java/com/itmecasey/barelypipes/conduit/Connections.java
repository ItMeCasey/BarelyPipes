/**
 * Works out which of a bundle's faces connect to something, by looking at the neighbors.
 *
 * <p>Each pipe joins the pipe of the same kind in a neighboring bundle on its own, whatever else
 * either bundle holds, unless either side has that face blocked; a machine or other block
 * attaches when it offers the capability the pipe carries. This only decides what is drawn, what
 * the wrench can target and where the transfer engine finds its endpoints; the moving itself
 * happens in the {@code transfer} package.
 *
 * <p>A redstone pipe has no capability to look for, so it attaches by what the block is: one that
 * gives off a signal ({@code isSignalSource}, such as a lever, button, repeater or redstone block) or
 * reports a comparator value ({@code hasAnalogOutputSignal}, such as a chest or a cauldron).
 * Blocks that only receive power (a lamp, a piston) attach only after the player sets that face
 * to EXPORT with the wrench, which is how a player says "power this one".
