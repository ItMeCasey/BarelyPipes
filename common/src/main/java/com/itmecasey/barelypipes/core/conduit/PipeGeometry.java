/**
 * The shape rules for pipes in a bundle, in pixels.
 *
 * <p>Every pipe is a 4 pixel square. A bundle of up to six pipes has to run straight along any of
 * the three axes and also turn corners, so each pipe gets a fixed position in all three
 * dimensions, not a flat slot. A pipe is a core cube at that position plus an arm from the core
 * to each connected face; an arm keeps the core's other two coordinates.
 *
 * <p>Positions are chosen so that, for every pair of pipes, at least two of the three coordinates
 * differ by 5 pixels or more. Looking along any axis, no two pipes then touch and each pair keeps
 * a pixel of clear space, so straight runs are clean in every direction, and an arm never runs
 * through another pipe's core. Where two pipes also differ on the third coordinate, their arms
 * cannot cross even at a corner. Up to three pipes get that everywhere; with four to six pipes
 * the lattice runs out of room and some corner combinations of different pipes still cross.
