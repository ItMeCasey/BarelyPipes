/**
 * The version of every kind of saved BarelyPipes data.
 *
 * <p>Each block entity (and each piece of world data) writes its kind's current version under the
 * {@value #TAG} key. A save with no such key was written before versioning and counts as version 0.
 * On load the data is compared with the current version: older data goes through the migration steps
 * of its kind, which are pure and live beside this class; data from a newer build is read as well as
 * it can be and reported once, since a downgrade cannot be undone but should never lose what it can read.
 *
 * <p>Raise a version only when the layout changes in a way old data needs help with, and add the step
 * for the old version at the same time ({@link MachineSaveMigrations} shows the pattern). A new optional
 * field that older data simply lacks needs a step too, an empty one, so the chain stays complete;
 * {@code SaveSchemaTest} fails when a version has no step.
